# SMFirebaseRemoteConfig

Today i learnd about RemoteConfig and DynamicLinks, but i don't understand concept of DynamicLinks. So i had to skip lesson.
But now i know about RemoteConfig. it is use for admin to control about app. i was so graceful to learn about using Firebase.
if i have chance to make app. i would use Firebase ! it was grate platform to me !
